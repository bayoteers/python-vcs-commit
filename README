python-vcs-commit

    Simple script that comments on bugzilla

    Parses the changelog contained in a commit message (either SVN or GIT or HG) and then comments on bugzilla the relevant bug

    It can be used with Subversion (svn.tigris.org), Mercurial (mercurial.selenic.com) or GIT (git-scm.com) version control systems.

INSTALLATION

    If running on Debian:

    debuild -us -uc -rfakeroot -I.git && sudo dpkg -i ../python-vcs-commit_<ver>_all.deb

    should be enough. 
    
    (It will ask for dependencies so probably putting it in a repo and doing apt-get install might be better)
